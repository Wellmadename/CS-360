Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
>>The application I developed was intended to be a simple and straightforward Android application for tracking weight. Users could enter their information and generate a weight-tracking table while also setting goal weights.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
>>When developing the application, I kept the user in mind throughout the entire process. Focusing on usability had been important in addressing the user experience. I designed the interfaces to be simplistic and easy
>>to interact with so users could navigate the application. This approach has proven to be very successful when addressing mobile applications as it increases overall inclusivity. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
>>Coding the application took quite some time, as I referenced material from Android repositories, YouTube, and Zybooks. The best way to make progress when developing applications is to review as much reference material as >>possible and continuously learn new ways to achieve your goals. I felt that the problems I faced had been encountered by others before me, and typically the information I needed was available somewhere. This approach was >>very successful in improving and modifying my code over time.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
>>Testing was simple because it was integrated into Android Studio. The multiple interfaces used to emulate the application across different devices, along with Logcat pointing out errors, allowed me to complete tests >>quickly. Every time I implemented something, I tested it thoroughly within the emulator and would annotate my findings.

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
>>Innovation comes in many forms when working on a full project, not just the UI or code. I had to overcome multiple challenges, starting with understanding my code environment and ending with putting the finishing touches >>on SMS features. There will always be challenges in development, but the best thing you can do is your best and plan for the future.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
>>I believe the specific component of the mobile app where I demonstrated the most success was navigation and movement between screens. It felt simple, and once I coded the buttons to function as intended, it felt almost >>empowering to transition smoothly between screens.
